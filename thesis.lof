\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1.1}{\ignorespaces A schematic representation of the Kitaev 1D wire. A set of $N$ sites denoted by the black dots and indexed by $j=1,..,N$ are connected by black lines. To each site we associate a fermion $a_{j}$ to which we associate a chemical potential $\mu \in \mathbb {R}$. We allow for fermions to tunnel to adjacent sites with amplitude $t\in \mathbb {R}$ and pair with adjacent fermions with amplitude $\Delta \in \mathbb {R}$ \relax }}{2}{figure.caption.4}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1.2}{\ignorespaces (Left) The energy gap, $\Delta E$ of the Kitaev wire as a function of the chemical potential, $\mu $, and the superconducting order parameter $\Delta $. The data was obtained via exact diagonalisation of \textup {\hbox {\mathsurround \z@ \normalfont (\ignorespaces \ref {eqn:KITKERN}\unskip \@@italiccorr )}}. (Right) The winding number, $\nu _{\text {1D}}$, of the Kitaev wire. Each gapped phase is separated by a gappless line as depicted in the diagram of the gap on the left.

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1.3}{\ignorespaces (Top) The Kitaev chain drawn in the Majorana basis. Each site $j$ supports two Majorana fermions $\gamma _{1,j}$ and $\gamma _{2,j}$. (Middle) The Majorana chain with $\mu >0$ and $\Delta =t=0$, leading to the Majoranas on the same site being paired together. This point in parameter space is in the trivial phase with $\nu _{\text {1D}}(\boldsymbol {\lambda })=0$. (Bottom) The Majorana chain with $\mu =0$ and $\Delta =t>0$, leading to Majoranas on adjacent sites being paired together. Due to the open boundary conditions, there are unpaired Majorana fermions at each end of the wire. \relax }}{6}{figure.caption.6}
